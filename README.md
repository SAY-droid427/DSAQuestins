# DSA QUESTIONS

Hello programmers! <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="20px" alt="hi">

This is a repository for data structures and algorithms. This has code in C++ till now. But you can contribute code to this repository in any language you know as long as it is correct and perfectly documented.

## ROADMAP FOR LEARNING DATA STRUCTURES ü§î

There is no well set roadmap for learning data structures and algorithms other than hard work, consistency and practice. Since this is a very vast field, therefore, only regular practice can help you become a good programmer.
If you are a complete beginner then this is what you can do to start learning coding:

1. Start learning the basics of any programming language of your own choice
2. Be patient and while your progress might seem to be slow, remember that learning data structures and algorithms can be a very daunting task and it has a steep learning curve.
3. Practice questions from GeeksForGeeks, Hackerrank and then slowly move onto Codechef. Participate in the Long Challenges.
4. Learn new concepts and at the same time, practice more questions on the above mentioned sites.
5. Now as you become more experienced with coding, shift to codeforces and keep onn practising.

## CodeHERS
Close your eyes and imagine an engineer! What do you see? Did you just see a guy wearing a hoodie sitting in front of the laptop? Yes, that is what majority of us imagine when we think of a person in tech! But why did we not imagine a girl working on a laptop? Because there are so less women in tech currently!
We need more women in tech!
I feel that coding becomes easier when involved in a community because a community becomes your inspiration and your support as you learn together and improve each day. For this reason, I have created a community "CodeHERS" for girls where they can come together and learn together. They can share their coding journey and inspire other women. This community will have the following features:

  - Teaching Git and Github to beginners
  - Sharing resources for web development and app development
  - Competitive coding server for getting started in CP
  - Show and tell: Where girls will be able to share and showcase the projects they built, the challenges they faced and how they overcame it
  - Since we are just starting this community, collaborations are welcome and encouraged!
